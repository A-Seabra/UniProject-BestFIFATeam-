# UniProject-BestFIFATeam-
University project about creating the best possible FIFA team according to specific parameters, using Scikit-Learn and Pandas in Python.

Developed by me, Artur Seabra, and my colleague, Tiago Zorro.

# General description:

As part of the final project for the Sensory Perception course, a challenge was proposed to develop a Python program. This program should be capable of selecting the best football team, considering a predetermined budget and maximum salary for the team. For this task, a FIFA 2023 dataset was used as a basis to select eleven players based on the available information.

The program asks the user for the acquisition amount (team's transfer budget) and the wage amount (allocated salary budget). In response, it provides a dictionary containing the positions and IDs of the players corresponding to each position. The program's performance is be evaluated based on several criteria related to the team. These criteria include the average overall rating, the variance of the overall rating, the players' positions, the total salary amount, the acquisition cost, and the youthfulness of the team.

To tackle this problem, we chose to use genetic algorithms.
